// NOTE: Using this Pair for now to store persistent lifecycle methods.
// By persistent methods i mean: PreDestroy, PreShutdown and Postshutdown.
// i treat them as persistent because they are stored, but are only executed when
// things are about to shutdown. So we "define" them early, but use only later.
